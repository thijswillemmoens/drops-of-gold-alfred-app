# Drops of Gold Theme for Alfred

P Drops of Gold Theme for Alfred is a professional Alfred color-scheme for maximum productivity. Based on the design from my personal website.

## How to install

1. Download [`Drops of Gold.alfredappearance`] or [`Drops with more Gold.alfredappearance`] — just click this link and Press <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> to save it as is on your system. Make sure the extension remains `.alfredappearance`
2. Double click to open it in Alfred, it will ask you to confirm the import. Do that.
3. Done!!!

### Use of Fonts
I personally use Brandon Text for my sans font. Unfortunately, it's a paid font, so I can't include it here. [For 35 dollars you can purchase it yourself.](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/brandon-text-font-hvd-fonts)

The More Gold version uses also my title font, [which is Filson Pro.](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/filson)
